## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I became more familiar with the grid concept, which I wasn't very accustomed to before. I realized I needed to do some research and reading about grids. It seemed more complicated than Flex, but now I understand it better. Especially in the desktop version, I became more accustomed to the placement and ordering of grids. It took me a long time to finish the project because there was a gap in time, and unfortunately, I had to remember and review the old code at each restart. However, I believe I have a much better understanding of the grid system now. The challenges are really well-prepared and improve practice with each step.
